    <h2>Darwin Among the Machines</h2>
    <h3>To the editor of the Press.</h3>

    <p>
        Sir, - There are few things of which the present generation is more justly proud of than the wonderful
        improvements which are daily taking place in all sorts of mechanical appliances. And indeed it is matter for
        great congratulation on many grounds. It is unnecessary to mention these here, for they are sufficiently
        obvious; our present business lies with considerations which may somewhat tend to humble our pride, and to make
        us think seriously of the future prospects of the human race. If we revert to the earliest primordial types of
        mechanical life, to the lever, the wedge, the inclined plane, the screw, and the pully, or (for analogy would
        lead us one step further) to that one primordial type from which all the mechanical kingdom has been developed,
        we mean to the lever itself, and if we then examine the machinery of the Great Easter, we find ourselves almost
        awestruck at the vast development of the mechanical world, at the gigantic strides with which it has advanced in
        comparison with the slow progress of the animal and the vegetable kindoms. We shall find it impossible to
        refrain from asking ourselves what the end of this mighty movement is to be. In what direction is it tending?
        What will be its upshot? To give a few imperfect hints towards the solution of these questions is the object of
        the present letter.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have used the words "mechanical life," the "mechanical kindom," "the mechanical world," and so forth, and we
        have done so advisedly, for as the vegatable kingdom was slowly developed from the mineral, and as, in like
        manner, the animal supervened upon the vegetable, so now in these last few ages an entirely new kingdom has
        sprung up, of which we as yet have only seen what will be one day considered the antediluvian prototypes of the
        race.
    </p>

    <p>
        We regret deeply that our knowledge both of natural history and of machinery is too small to enable us to
        undertake the gigantic task of classifying machines into their genera and subgenera, species, varieties,
        subvarieties, and so forth, of tracing the connecting links between machines of widely different characters, of
        pointing out how subservience to the use of man has played that part amoung machines which natural selection has
        performed in the animal and vegetable kindoms, of pointing out rudimentary organs, [see note] which exist in
        some few machines, feebly developed and perfectly useless, yet serving to mark descent from some ancestral type,
        which has either perished or been modified into some new phase of mchanical existence. We can only point out
        this field for investigation; it must be followed up by others whose education and talents have been of a much
        higher order than any which we can lay claim to.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some few hints we have determined to venture upon, though we do so with the profoundest diffidence. Firstly, we
        would remark that as some of the lowest of the vertebrata attained a far greater size than has descended to
        their more highly organized living representatives, so a diminution in the size of machines has often attended
        their development and progress. Take the watch for instance. Examine the beautiful structure of the little
        animal, watch the intelligent play of the minute members which compose it; yet this little creature is but a
        development of the cumbrous clocks of the thirteenth century - it is no deterioration from them. The day may
        come when clocks, which certainly at the present time are not diminishing in bulk, may be entirely superseded by
        the universal use of watches, in which case clocks will become extinct like the earlier saurians, while the
        watch (whose tendency has for some years been rather to decrease in size than the contrary) will remain the only
        existing type of an extinct race.
    </p>

    <p>
        The views of machinery which we are thus feebly indicating will suggest the solution of one of the greatest and
        most mysterious questions of the day. We refer to the question what sort of creature man's next successor in the
        supremacy of the earth is likely to be. We have often heard this debated; but it appears to us that we are
        ourselves creating our own successors; we are daily adding to the beauty and delicacy of their physical
        organization; we are daily giving them greater power, and supplying, by all sorts of ingenious contrivances,
        that self-regualting, self-acting power, which will be to them what intellect has been to the human race. In the
        course of ages we shall find ourselves the inferior race. Inferior in power, inferior in that great moral
        quality of self control, we shall look up to them as to the acme of all that the best and wisest man can ever
        dare to aim at. No evil passions, no jealousy, no avarice, no impure desires will disturb the serene might of
        those glorious creatures. Sin, shame, and sorrow, will have no place among them. Their minds will be in a state
        of perpetual calm, the contentment of a spirit that knows no wants, is disturbed by no regrets. Ambition will
        never torture them. Ingratitude will never cause them the uneasiness of a moment. The guilty conscience, the
        hope deferred, the pains of exile, "the insolence of office, and the scorns which patient merit the unworth
        takes," these will be entirely unkown to them. If they want "feeding," (by the use of which very word we betray
        our recognition of them as living organisms) they will be attended by patient slaves whose business and interest
        it will be to see that they shall want for nothing. If they are out of order they will be promptly attended to
        by physicians who are thoroughly acquainted with their constitutions; if they die, for even these glorious
        animals will not be exempt from that necessary and universal consummation, they will immediately enter into a
        new phase of existence, for what machine dies entirely in every part at one and the same instant?
    </p>

    <p>
        We take it that when the state of things shall have arrived which we have been above attempting to describe, man
        will have become to the machine what the horse and the dog are to man. He will continue to exist, may even to
        improve, and will be probably better off in his state of domestication under the beneficent rule of the machines
        than he is in his present wild state. We treat our horses, dogs, cattle and sheep, on the whole, with great
        kindness, we give them whatever experience teaches us to be best for them, and there can be no doubt that our
        use of meat has added to the happiness of the lower animals far more than it has detracted from it: in like
        manner it is reasonable to suppose that the machines will treat us kindly, for their existence is as dependent
        upon us as ours is upon the lower animals. They cannot kill us and eat us as we do sheep, they will not only
        require our services in the parturition of their young, (which branch of their economy will remain always in our
        hands) but also in feeling them, in setting them right if they are sick, and burying their dead, or working up
        their corpses into new machines. It is obvious that if all the animals in Great Britain save man alone were to
        die, and if at the same time all intercourse with foreign countries were by some sudden catastrophe to be
        rendered perfectly impossible, it is obvious that under such circumstances the loss of human life would be
        something fearful to contemplate - in like manner, were mankind to cease, the machines would be as badly off or
        even worse. The fact is that our interests are inseperable from theirs, and theirs from ours. Each race is
        dependent upon the other for innumerable benefits and until the reproductive organs of the machines have been
        developed in a manner which we are hardly yet able to conceive, they are entirely dependent upon man for even
        the continuation of the species. It is true that these organs may be ultimately developed, inasmuch as man's
        interest lies in that direction; there is nothing which our infatuated race would more desire than to see a
        fertile union between two steam engines; it is true that machinery is even at this present time employed in
        begetting machinery, in becoming the parent of machines often after its own kind, but the days of flirtation,
        courtship, and matrimony appear to be very remote, and, indeed, can hardly be realised by our feeble and
        imperfect imaginations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Day by day however the machines are gaining ground upon us; day by day we are becoming more subservient to them;
        more men are daily bound down as slaves to tend them, more men are daily devoting the energies of their whole
        lives to the development of mechanical life. The upshot is simply a question of time, but that the time will
        come when the machines will hold the real supremacy over the world and its inhabitants, is what no person of a
        truly philosophical man can for a moment question.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our opinion is that war to the death should be instantly proclaimed against them. Every machine of every sort
        should be destroyed by the well-wisher of his species. Let there be no exceptions made, no quarter shown; let us
        at once go back to the primeval condition of the race. If it be urged that this is impossible under the present
        condition of human affairs, this at once proves that the mischief is already done, that our servitude has
        commenced in good earnest, that we have raised a race of beings whom it is beyond our power to destroy, and that
        we are not only enslaved but are absolutely acquiescent in our bondage.
    </p>

    <p>
        For the present we will leave this subject, which we present gratis to the members of the Philosophical Society.
        Should they consent to avail themselves of the vast field which we have pointed out, we shall endeavour to
        labour in it ourselves at some future and indefinite period.

        Note. - We were asked by a learned brother philosopher who saw this article in M.S., what we meant by alluding
        to rudimentary organs in machines. Could we, he asked, give any example of such organs? We pointed to the little
        protuberance at the bottom of the bowl of our tobacco pipe. This organ was originally designed for the same
        purpose as the rim at the bottom of a tea-cup, which is but another form of the same function. Its purpose was
        to keep the heat of the pipe from marking the table on which it rested. Originally, as we have seen in very
        early tobacco pipes, this protuberance was of a very different shape to what it is now. It was broad at the
        bottom and flat, so that while the pipe was being smoked the bowl might rest upon the table. Use and disuse has
        here come into play, and served to reduce the function to its present rudimentary condition. That these
        rudimentary organs are rarer in machinery than in animal life, is owing to the more prompt action of the human
        selection, as compared with the slower but even surer operation of natural selection. Man may make mistakes, in
        the long run nature never does so. We have only given an imperfect example, but the intelligent reader will
        supply himself with illustrations. - C.
